A compact calendar indicator for the GNOME panel, inspired by [Itsycal](https://github.com/sfsam/itsycal) for macOS.

## About

Litsycal brings the simplicity of Itsycal to Linux. Click the panel indicator to reveal a small monthly calendar. No frills, no clutter.

**Supported GNOME Shell versions:** 48, 49, 50

**Get it on [extensions.gnome.org](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/10933/litsycal/).**

## Keyboard Shortcuts

While the calendar popup is open, these keys work — arrow keys and vi-style
`h`/`j`/`k`/`l` both move the selected day around (use `j` in place of `Down`
if the arrow key doesn't respond, since GNOME Shell reserves it for its own
menu navigation). The rest mirror [Itsycal's own shortcuts](https://www.mowglii.com/itsycal/help),
with Ctrl standing in for Itsycal's Command key (there's no Command key on
Linux):

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `←` / `h` | Previous day |
| `→` / `l` | Next day |
| `↑` / `k` | Previous week |
| `j` | Next week |
| `Shift + ←` / `Shift + H` | Previous month |
| `Shift + →` / `Shift + L` | Next month |
| `Shift + ↑` / `Shift + K` | Next year |
| `Shift + ↓` / `Shift + J` | Previous year |
| `Space` | Jump to today |
| `#` | Show selected day's offset from today and day of year |
| `Ctrl + J` / `Ctrl + K` | Add/remove a week row in the calendar |
| `P` | Pin the calendar open (unpinning is click-only — see below) |
| `W` | Show/hide calendar week numbers |
| `.` | Show/hide event locations in the agenda |
| `Ctrl + ,` | Open Settings |
| `Ctrl + O` | Open the default calendar app |
| `Ctrl + F` | Search events across every connected calendar, roughly a year back and forward |
| `Ctrl + Shift + J` | Open the first active virtual meeting in the agenda |
| `Ctrl + N` | Create a new event |
| `Ctrl + Shift + N` | Quick-add an event from a one-liner (e.g. "Lunch tomorrow 12pm at Cafe Nero") — opens the full form pre-filled with whatever it recognized, for you to confirm or fix before saving |
| `Ctrl + Shift + T` | Go to date |
| `Ctrl + Alt + R` | Refresh events |
| `Ctrl + Q` | Quit Litsycal |

Pinning is the one shortcut that only works in one direction. A pinned
calendar deliberately doesn't hold keyboard focus — that's the whole point,
so the rest of your desktop stays usable while it stays visible — which means
no shortcut reaches it once it's pinned. Unpin by clicking the pin button
again (or by clicking the panel button, which unpins and reopens the popup).

Quick-add recognizes weekday names in your system's own locale automatically
(no translation needed for those), but the fixed keywords — "today",
"tomorrow", "next", and the word for "at" — currently only match their
English form until a translation adds the local equivalent (see
`quickAddParser.js` if you're contributing one).

### Event info popover

Clicking an event in the agenda opens a small read-only popover with its details, right next to the row — itsycal's own popover, ported. These keys work while it's open:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Esc` | Close the popover |
| `Backspace` / `Delete` | Delete the event (asks you to confirm first, same as the edit dialog's own Delete button) |

Clicking anywhere outside the popover closes it; clicking a different event closes this one and opens that event's popover in the same click. Editing an event is one step further away now — right-click the event and choose **Edit…**.

### Time zones

Add time zones under **Preferences → General → Time Zones** to show live clocks between the agenda and the footer. To also show how far ahead or behind each one is (e.g. `São Paulo ........ 14:32 (-6h)`), set **Home Timezone** in the same page — pick your home city, or use **Detect my location**. The offset labels stay hidden while Home Timezone is unset; it's deliberately a separate setting rather than your system's timezone, so the offsets stay correct while you travel.

## Installation

### Dependencies

Calendar events require [Evolution Data Server](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/evolution-data-server). Without it, Litsycal still opens — the calendar grid and time-zone clocks work — but no calendars or events are available.

- **Debian/Ubuntu:** `sudo apt install evolution-data-server gir1.2-edataserver-1.2 gir1.2-ecal-2.0 gir1.2-ical-3.0`
- **Fedora:** `sudo dnf install evolution-data-server`

### From extensions.gnome.org (recommended)

Install Litsycal from its page on GNOME Extensions:
**[extensions.gnome.org/extension/10933/litsycal](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/10933/litsycal/)**

Toggle it on there (with the GNOME Shell browser integration installed), or
use the Extension Manager app and search for "Litsycal". Updates arrive
automatically through GNOME's extension updater.

### From source

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:mlkonrad/litsycal.git
   ```

2. Copy to your GNOME extensions directory:
   ```bash
   cp -r litsycal ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/litsycal@mlkonrad.github.com
   ```

3. Compile the settings schema:
   ```bash
   glib-compile-schemas ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/litsycal@mlkonrad.github.com/schemas/
   ```

4. Restart GNOME Shell and enable the extension:
   ```bash
   gnome-extensions enable litsycal@mlkonrad.github.com
   ```
