# Litsycal dev notes

## Pre-push checks (`node`/`npm` aren't installed system-wide here)

This machine has no system `node`/`npm` (and no passwordless `sudo` to
install one), so `npm run lint` — and therefore any real ESLint check —
silently couldn't run for a while (2026-09-12: three separate commits landed
with lint errors CI caught but nothing local ever did: two missing-JSDoc
violations and one `operator-assignment` violation, all in newly-added
functions). `gjs`'s own syntax check (`Reflect.parse`) only catches actual
syntax errors, not lint rules — it says nothing about whether ESLint would
pass.

Fix in place: a portable Node.js build extracted (no root needed) to
`~/.local/opt/node-v22.23.2`, symlinked from `~/.local/bin/{node,npm,npx}`
(already on `PATH`). If that ever goes missing on a fresh machine/environment,
redo it rather than assuming CI is the only place this can be checked:

```bash
curl -sLo /tmp/node.tar.xz "https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v22.x/node-v22.<latest>-linux-x64.tar.xz"
mkdir -p ~/.local/opt && tar xf /tmp/node.tar.xz -C ~/.local/opt
ln -sf ~/.local/opt/node-v22.<latest>-linux-x64/bin/{node,npm,npx} ~/.local/bin/
```

`scripts/check.sh` runs the exact same steps as `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
(schema compile dry-run, ESLint, JS syntax check, `.po`/`.pot` validation) —
run it by hand before pushing, or rely on `.githooks/pre-push`, which calls
it automatically and blocks the push on failure. Git doesn't read hooks out
of a repo's own tree by default, so the hook only fires once per clone after
running:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

(already set in this checkout). Keep `scripts/check.sh` in sync with
`ci.yml` if either one's steps change — they're meant to be identical.

## Local install is a symlink

On this machine, `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/litsycal@mlkonrad.github.com`
is a **symlink** to this repo (not a copy). Editing files here is editing what
GNOME Shell loads — there is no separate deploy/copy step.

Do NOT run `cp -r` over that path (per the README's install instructions) —
that would replace the symlink with a real directory and silently break this
setup, bringing back the "edits don't show up" problem.

To reload after a code change (schema changes need the compile step too):

```bash
glib-compile-schemas schemas/ --strict   # only needed after editing schemas/*.xml
gnome-extensions disable litsycal@mlkonrad.github.com
gnome-extensions enable litsycal@mlkonrad.github.com
```

`schemas/gschemas.compiled` is generated and gitignored — always regenerate it
in place after touching the `.xml` schema, since GNOME reads it from here now.

## GNOME Shell module caching caveat

`disable`/`enable` does not reliably reload changed `extension.js` code in
every GNOME Shell session (observed on Shell 50 — the old module can stay
cached even across a clean disable/enable cycle). If behavior still looks
stale after reloading, a full log out/in is the sure fix — GNOME Shell can't
restart in place on Wayland like it can on X11 (`Alt+F2` → `r`).

## Fast iteration: nested devkit session (no logout needed)

`mutter-devkit` (installed on this machine, package `mutter-devkit`,
matches this machine's Shell 50) lets you spin up a throwaway nested Shell
that reads the same `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/` symlink and
the same dconf `enabled-extensions` list as the real session, without
touching it:

```bash
./scripts/dev-session.sh
```

This is a one-shot process — after editing JS, kill it (`Ctrl+C` or close
its window) and re-run the script to get a fresh interpreter with the new
code loaded. That's the same "JS can't be unloaded" constraint as the
caveat above; the nested session just makes paying that cost cheap (a few
seconds, not a full logout) instead of expensive. The script also disables
xdg-desktop-portal/Secret Service probing, which otherwise adds ~30s to
every launch.

Use this for iterating on JS logic and layout. Still fall back to a full
log out/in for anything that depends on the real session specifically
(actual notification daemon, real background apps/indicators, hardware,
lock screen) or if something looks stale in the nested session and you
need to rule out a devkit-specific quirk.

### The nested session has its own private evolution-data-server

`dev-session.sh` launches gnome-shell under `dbus-run-session`, which gives
the nested session its own isolated D-Bus session bus, separate from your
real login session's. Since EDS (evolution-source-registry,
evolution-calendar-factory) is D-Bus-activated per session bus, the nested
session gets its own separate EDS process — not the one your real session
already has running. Calendar *source config* (the `.source` files under
`~/.config/evolution/sources/`) is shared, so the nested session sees the
same calendars, but each EDS process keeps its own in-memory view of
backend data, refreshed only by its own live-update signals.

Practical effect: a calendar data change made against your real session
(adding/editing/deleting an event via GNOME Calendar, a script, or another
tool) is invisible to the nested session — its litsycal instance won't
live-update, because the write happened on a different EDS process it was
never notified by — even though a raw query against the *real* session's
EDS would show the change immediately. Confirmed for real testing the
attendee-colors feature (2026-09-12): a test event created against the
outer session's bus never appeared in the nested session's agenda; the
same event created against the nested session's own bus (its address is in
the nested `gnome-shell --devkit` process's environment as
`DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS`, readable via `/proc/<pid>/environ` for a quick
one-off script) showed up live, no restart needed — proving litsycal's own
live-view refresh logic (`calendarManager.js`'s `_startView`) works fine;
the missed update was purely a which-EDS-process problem, not a litsycal
bug.

So: to test a calendar data change inside the nested session, either make
it through a client connected to the nested session's own bus, or just
restart the nested session (kill + re-run `dev-session.sh`) — a fresh
launch's EDS process reads the on-disk backend data fresh, same as the
"JS can't be unloaded" restart above but for data instead of code.

## Negative CSS margin corrupts St layout on this Shell version

Hit for real fixing the event info popover, 2026-09-12 (see CHANGELOG's
Unreleased/Fixed entry): a negative `margin` on an St widget's style class —
`.litsycal-info-popover-link-btn` had `margin: -2px -4px;`, meant to offset
extra `padding` for a bigger hover/click area — corrupts that widget's
`get_preferred_height()`/`get_height()` on this machine's GNOME Shell/Mutter
build (Shell 50 dev, `mutter-18`/`St-18` typelibs) to exactly `8589934592`
(2^33), regardless of the widget's actual content. Reproduced identically on
both `St.Button` and a plain `St.BoxLayout` — it's not a `St.Button`-specific
bug. A *hard* CSS `width`/`height` value on a widget is respected fine; a
*soft* `max-height` on an ancestor does **not** clamp this corrupted value —
it passes straight through. No JS exception is thrown anywhere, so this
class of bug is invisible to `journalctl` error-grepping; the corrupted
number just silently becomes the actor's real allocated size, blowing up
(or collapsing) whatever contains it.

If a popup/panel ever renders at a wildly wrong size again with nothing in
the logs, grep `stylesheet.css` for `margin: -` on the actor involved before
suspecting a JS logic bug. More generally, the fastest way to debug "insane
size, no exception" bugs in this project is live, on this machine's actual
running GNOME Shell (see "Local install is a symlink" above): temporarily
add `console.error()` calls logging `get_width()`/`get_height()` and each
child's `get_preferred_height()`, reload, ask for a repro click, then
`journalctl --user -b 0 | grep <marker>`. Stylesheet-only changes reload
reliably via plain disable/enable; JS module changes need the full log
out/in from the caveat above to be sure they took effect — don't trust a
disable/enable alone when chasing a change that doesn't seem to have landed.

## extensions.gnome.org review guidelines (publishing target)

Full guide: https://gjs.guide/extensions/review-guidelines/review-guidelines.html
GNOME also publishes a second, LLM-targeted checklist aimed specifically at
AI coding assistants working on GNOME Shell extensions:
https://gjs.guide/extensions/review-guidelines/best-practices.html
(originally the EGO reviewer's open letter "EGO AI reference",
https://blogs.gnome.org/jrahmatzadeh/2026/07/27/ego-ai-reference/ - the
post asks AI tools to re-check it for updates; raw Markdown at
https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/javascript/gjs-guide/-/raw/main/docs/extensions/review-guidelines/best-practices.md).
This project is being prepared for submission to the official EGO review, so
new code should keep meeting these — checked clean as of 2026-09-07:

- **Lifecycle discipline**: nothing gets created, connected, or scheduled at
  module scope — only in `enable()`. Everything created in `enable()` must be
  torn down in `disable()` (widgets destroyed, every signal disconnected,
  every `GLib.timeout_add*`/`source_remove`d, instance vars set back to
  `null`).
  - **Signals: always `connectObject()`/`disconnectObject()`, never bare
    `connect()`** in Shell-process files (EGO reviewer asked for this,
    2026-09-24; prefs.js is GTK-side and exempt). Pass the owner last —
    `this` in class methods, or the owning actor in module-level functions
    (see `confirmDeleteEvent`'s `overlay` in eventDialog.js). Handlers on
    child actors destroyed with their owner clean themselves up; handlers on
    anything that outlives the owner (settings, `_iface`, `global.stage`,
    the registry, `this.menu`) need an explicit `emitter.disconnectObject(this)`
    in `destroy()`/`close()`, in the usual order (sources first, then
    signals, then resources, then `super.destroy()`).
  - `disconnectObject(owner)` removes **every** handler that owner has on
    that emitter, so don't connect/disconnect temporary handlers on an
    emitter that also carries permanent ones for the same owner — connect
    them all once instead (see the resize handle in calendarWidget.js).
  - `ECal.Client.connect(...)` in calendarManager.js is EDS's async client
    connect, not a signal — it's the one legitimate `connect(` left.
  - `Gjs-CRITICAL "Attempting to run a JS callback during garbage
    collection"` warnings during disable/enable in the nested devkit session
    are NOT from litsycal: the blocked callbacks are layout vfuncs
    (`get_preferred_width`, `allocate`, ...) that litsycal doesn't implement,
    from other enabled extensions, and they occur at commits from before the
    connectObject migration too (measured 2026-09-24). Check teardown with
    "already disposed" / litsycal file paths in the log instead.
- **No deprecated imports**: no `ByteArray`, `Lang`, or `Mainloop`. Use ESM
  `import`, GLib/GObject natively, `imports.byteArray` replacements, etc.
- **Don't mix process libraries**: no `Gtk`/`Gdk`/`Adw` in extension.js (Shell
  process) and no `St`/`Clutter`/`Meta` in prefs.js (separate process, GTK
  only). Keep that split when adding to either file. helpers.js is
  imported by Shell-process files (indicator.js, calendarWidget.js, etc.)
  but is NOT safe to import from prefs.js: its
  `import {gettext as _} from 'resource:///org/gnome/shell/extensions/extension.js'`
  is a Shell-process-only resource path (prefs.js's own gettext comes from
  `resource:///org/gnome/Shell/Extensions/js/extensions/prefs.js` — a
  different namespace). Importing helpers.js from prefs.js throws
  `ImportError: Unable to load file from: resource:///org/gnome/shell/
  extensions/extension.js` and breaks Preferences outright (hit for real
  building the second-time-zone feature, 2026-09-11) — any prefs-only logic
  belongs directly in prefs.js instead, even if it looks generic enough to
  share. Also note: `org.gnome.Shell.Extensions` (the prefs window's D-Bus
  service) caches its modules across `gnome-extensions prefs` invocations
  like gnome-shell itself does for extension.js — after fixing a prefs.js
  import bug, `pkill -f org.gnome.Shell.Extensions` before retesting, or the
  old broken import stays cached.
- **No unnecessary try/catch or optional-chaining guards**: don't wrap
  standard GObject/GLib methods (`destroy()`, `connect()`, `disconnect()`,
  `abort()`, `GLib.Source.remove()`) in try/catch, and don't `?.()`-guard a
  call to a method that's guaranteed to exist on the object's type — both
  read as defensive padding to reviewers. Already audited in this repo
  (commit b4321e9, 2026-09-11) and found NOT to be violations — don't
  re-flag these without new evidence:
  - `Gio.Subprocess`/`Gio.AppInfo.launch_default_for_uri` calls in
    eventDialog.js/eventInfoPopover.js/calendarWidget.js/prefs.js wrapped in
    try/catch — launching an external app/URI handler can fail for real
    reasons (app not installed, invalid URI), unlike a GObject method call.
  A try/catch around a call that can genuinely throw is fine either way —
  keep the short comment explaining why, as these already do.
  Two earlier "not a violation" entries were reversed on 2026-09-13 and
  removed from the code — don't reintroduce them: `?.()` on ICalGLib
  getters (the methods always exist; a missing iCal field makes the getter
  return `null`), and try/catch-wrapped `client.disconnect(null)` on ECal
  clients (ECal.Client has no disconnect of its own — that's GObject's
  signal disconnect with handler id 0, which logs a GLib critical per
  calendar instead of throwing).
- **No lifecycle guard flags**: don't add booleans like `this._destroyed` to
  prevent post-destroy races — null out the instance var on cleanup instead
  and let that be the guard (already the pattern everywhere in this repo).
  Also no early return at the top of a teardown method (`_finish()`,
  `close()`, `destroy()`): `if (!this._box) return;` as the first line of
  `FloatingModalPanel._finish()` was rejected as "selective disable"
  (2026-09-24). Cleanup must run unconditionally; make it run once by having
  the owner null its reference in the `onClose` callback and only call
  `?.close()` on a live reference (see `_openSearch()` in calendarWidget.js).
- **`destroy()` order**: remove timeouts/GLib sources first, then disconnect
  signals, then release other resources, then call `super.destroy()` last.
  Override `destroy()` directly on GObject-derived widgets rather than
  connecting to the `destroy` signal — but a JS `destroy()` override only
  runs when JS calls it. A child actor destroyed from C along with its
  parent (a menu item, a container) skips it entirely, so the owner must
  call `destroy()` on such children explicitly, as
  `LitsycalIndicator.destroy()` does for the calendar widget. Hit for real
  2026-09-13: on every disable (each screen lock) `LitsycalCalendar.destroy()`
  never ran, leaking its settings handlers and CalendarManager. Verify
  teardown by changing a setting after disable and watching the log for
  "has been already disposed" criticals, not by reading destroy().
- **Icons and progress**: use `Gtk.Image`/`St.Icon` for icons (never emoji
  glyphs), and shell widgets (`St.Bin`, GNOME's bar-level widget) for
  progress, not ASCII bars. "Emoji" includes any Unicode symbol used as a
  button or indicator graphic: `‹ › ● ▾ ↗ ✓ ✕` etc. in an `St.Button`
  `label:` or an `St.Label` `text:` were all flagged by the EGO reviewer
  (2026-09-24) and replaced with Adwaita symbolic icons (`go-previous`/
  `go-next`, `media-record`, `pan-down`, `web-browser`), in the repo's
  `child: new St.Icon({icon_name, icon_size})` form. Check with
  `grep -nP "(label|text):\s*['\"][^'\"]*[^\x00-\x7F]" *.js` - only
  typography inside real text (`…`, `—` in translatable strings) may remain.
- **Comments**: no trivial comments that just restate what the next line of
  JS does — matches this project's existing no-comments-unless-non-obvious
  rule above the fold in this file. Keep comments (JS and CSS) plain ASCII:
  no box-drawing section headers (`// ── Init ───`), em dashes, arrows,
  ellipsis characters or Mac key glyphs (`⌘⇧⌥⌃` — write `Cmd+`/`Shift+`/
  `Opt+`/`Ctrl+`). The EGO reviewer rejected a build for these "wrong
  characters" (2026-09-24). User-facing strings may still use proper
  typography (`…`, `—`) — this is only about comments.
- **Settings pairing**: `settings-schema` in metadata.json is paired with a
  parameterless `this.getSettings()` call — already true in extension.js and
  prefs.js; don't reintroduce the old schema-path-argument form, and don't
  hard-code the schema id as a global constant (no JS file mentions it).
- **Structural**: keep `enable()`/`disable()` adjacent in extension.js for
  easy diffing, keep the entry-point file small with logic split into
  single-responsibility modules (already the shape of this repo), avoid
  unjustified method aliases, and co-locate a timeout's removal check
  immediately before the line that creates its replacement (see the
  `_dayInfoTimeoutId` pattern in calendarWidget.js).
  - **Every** `timeout_add*`/`idle_add` stored in a variable gets that
    `if (id) { GLib.source_remove(id); id = null; }` block right before it,
    even when it can only ever be created once (in a constructor or a
    one-shot init). The EGO reviewer rejected `bcb3730` for exactly that
    case (`_registryStartupPumpId` in `CalendarManager._initRegistry()`,
    2026-09-27). A helper that removes it (`_cancelTooltip()`) called on
    the line before also counts.
  - **One property per timeout.** Never store two different timeouts in the
    same id property, even when they're mutually exclusive: the cell and
    footer tooltips sharing `_tooltipTimeoutId` was flagged (2026-09-24) and
    split into `_cellTooltipTimeoutId`/`_btnTooltipTimeoutId`, both removed
    in `_cancelTooltip()`.
  - **Keep cleanup visible where it's defined.** Reviewers read each file on
    its own: an empty base-class hook that a subclass overrides
    (`_onFinish()`, called from `FloatingModalPanel._finish()`) was flagged
    as "defined but never called, so not cleaning up on disable". Override
    the real method and call `super` instead (`SearchPanel._finish()`), so
    the call path is visible in the subclass's own file.
  - **Each class owns its resources end to end**: signals, timeouts, Soup
    sessions, `Gio.Cancellable`s are created and cleaned up by the same
    class - never created in one class and torn down by another.
  - **No placeholder `enable()`/`disable()` stubs**, and extract repeated
    code into helpers rather than copy-pasting it.
  - **Lines <= 200 characters** (no JS line exceeds it, checked 2026-10-13).
  - **Organize by process**: prefs-only modules belong under a `prefs/`
    directory, and any module shared by extension.js and prefs.js must not
    import `St`/`Clutter`/`Gtk`/`Gdk`/`Adw`. The repo is currently flat
    (prefs logic all inside prefs.js), so this only bites if prefs.js ever
    gets split into modules.
  - **Avoid spawning external commands**; prefer D-Bus for system services,
    and move heavy work into a separate app talking over D-Bus. The two
    existing `Gio.Subprocess.new` calls (`gnome-calendar --date` in
    calendarWidget.js, `gnome-control-center online-accounts` in prefs.js)
    are fire-and-forget app launches on user click, not background work -
    acceptable, but don't add more without a reason.
  - **Single Shell version** is the guide's default; multi-version support
    should follow the EGO Port Guide. metadata.json lists 48/49/50 and EGO
    approved `2693fdd` with that, so it isn't a blocker - but re-verify
    each listed version actually works when pruning before an upload.
- **AI-generated code notices**: this checklist asks AI assistants to flag
  AI-authored code with a comment unless the human author understands the
  JavaScript, and for an author who does understand it to strip such
  comments before EGO upload. Not applicable here as a literal comment (the
  user reads and directs every change), but keep the intent: don't let
  generated code ship without the user having actually reviewed it.
- **No `eval`, no obfuscated/minified code, no bundled binaries**. If a build
  step is ever introduced, ship readable transpiled output, not minified.
- **No telemetry/tracking of users**, no clipboard access without declaring
  it, no sharing data with third parties without explicit user action.
- **Logging**: keep `console.log`/`print` out of normal operation (currently
  zero in the codebase) — noisy logging is a rejection reason.
- **metadata.json**: uuid must stay in the `litsycal@mlkonrad.github.com` form
  (no `gnome.org` namespace — already fine); `shell-version` should list
  stable versions plus at most one unreleased/dev version, trimmed as new
  Shell versions ship; only necessary keys. Don't hand-set a `version` key —
  it's marked Deprecated in the guide ("set for internal use by
  extensions.gnome.org"); EGO assigns it on upload.
- **GSettings schema id** must stay under the `org.gnome.shell.extensions.*`
  base (already true: `org.gnome.shell.extensions.litsycal`).
- **`GObject.Object.run_dispose()`**: treat as forbidden. shexli flags any
  call (EGO-X-003) and the user confirmed EGO doesn't accept it
  (2026-09-27) - a documented reason in a comment is not enough. It was
  briefly used for the logout crash below and replaced.
- **EDS `SourceRegistry` lives on a private `GLib.MainContext`**
  (`CalendarManager._initRegistry()`), run by `_pumpRegistry()` on a timer
  (100 ms until the registry exists, then every 5 s). Don't move it back to
  the Shell's context. `source_registry_dispose()` drains the context that
  was thread-default when the registry was created; on the Shell's context
  that drain ran from whichever GC freed the registry, and at Shell exit
  (extensions are never disabled first) that GC is GJS's own teardown,
  where the drain dispatched GJS's callback-less promise-queue child source
  and gnome-shell segfaulted on every logout (237 of 243 gnome-shell core
  dumps, 2026-09-06 to 09-24). Corollary: anything async started from a
  registry callback must not inherit the private context - GTask pushes its
  own context as thread-default while running a callback, so
  `_connectSource()` pushes `GLib.MainContext.default()` around
  `ECal.Client.connect()` (without it, calendars only progressed every 5 s).
  A nested devkit session exiting with code 139 was this crash; check
  `coredumpctl info <pid>` for `source_registry_dispose` before blaming a
  new change.
- Code must be genuinely functional (not a stub) and avoid interfering with
  other extensions or the shell's own systems.
- **Unnecessary files**: the guide's Recommendations discourage shipping
  `.po`/`.pot` files, build/install scripts, and unused media — a reviewer
  *may* reject for an unreasonable amount of unnecessary data. If the EGO
  upload is a zip of the whole repo rather than hand-picked files, exclude
  `.git`, `.github`, `CLAUDE.md`, `po/` (source `.po`/`.pot`/`LINGUAS`),
  `screenshot.png`, `package.json`/`package-lock.json` (dev-only, just the
  `eslint` devDependency + lint script — no build/bundle step), and
  `eslint.config.js` (lint config, also dev-only); keep only the compiled
  `locale/pt_BR/LC_MESSAGES/*.mo`, which is what actually ships at runtime.
- **Licensing**: `LICENSE` is MIT (Marlon Konrad, 2026), reproduces Itsycal's
  original MIT notice (Sanjay Madan, 2016 — litsycal ports/adapts parts of
  its design and behavior, e.g. `_makeOverflow`'s `MoCalCell` comment and
  `_updateAgendaMaxHeight`'s `agendaMaxPossibleHeight` comment in
  calendarWidget.js, so MIT's "include the original notice" condition applies),
  and adds an explicit grant permitting extensions.gnome.org/GNOME Foundation
  to distribute under GPL-2.0-or-later-compatible terms — the pattern the
  guide describes for permissively-licensed extension code. Keep all three
  sections if LICENSE is ever regenerated/reformatted.
- **Naming**: "Litsycal" echoes "Itsycal" closely enough (same product
  category, near-identical name, README/LICENSE assert direct lineage) that
  it was worth clearing with the original author before wider distribution —
  Sanjay Madan approved the name and the "port of Itsycal" framing directly
  (contacted by email 2026-09-08, approval received same day). The email
  thread is the written record — check that if this ever needs revisiting.
- Before submitting: run through metadata.json shell-version pruning, confirm
  `schemas/gschemas.compiled` isn't committed stale, confirm no unnecessary
  files are in the upload, and skim for any new `enable()`-time side effects
  introduced since the last review pass.
