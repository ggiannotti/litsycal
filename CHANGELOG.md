# Changelog

All notable changes to Litsycal are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
This project doesn't yet use semantic version tags — entries are grouped by
release instead, numbered sequentially ([1], [2], [3], …). This counter is
maintained by hand here and is independent of `metadata.json` (which no
longer carries a `version` key — see that file's history for why).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- A "Litsycal logo" panel icon style (Preferences > Appearance > Icon
  style), showing the Litsycal logo in the top bar instead of the date. The
  month, weekday, time and custom pattern options are greyed out while it's
  selected, since there is no date text for them to change. A meeting
  countdown still replaces the logo, or sits next to it in "Show alongside
  icon text" mode.
- Keyboard navigation in event search and the event popover. In search
  (Ctrl+F), the Up and Down arrows move between the search field and the
  results, and Enter opens the highlighted one. In an event's popover, Tab
  and Shift+Tab move through the delete button and the event's links, and
  Esc now closes the popover whichever of them is focused.
- A colour choice for the band across the top of the calendar icon styles
  (Preferences > Appearance > Calendar band colour): a custom colour (red,
  as before, by default) or your system accent colour, as is or a little
  lighter or darker. The accent options follow the accent colour when you
  change it in GNOME Settings. The band is also a little thinner now.

### Fixed

- The agenda's height limit is now applied from the first time the menu
  opens. Before, that first open left the agenda uncapped, so a busy week
  could push the popup past the bottom of the screen, and GNOME Shell's log
  got an "Ignoring length property that isn't a number" warning each time.

### Fixed

- Litsycal now opens on systems without Evolution Data Server installed
  (#10). It used to fail to load at all there; the calendar libraries are
  now loaded only when needed, so without them you get the grid and the
  time-zone clocks, just no calendars or events.

### Fixed

- Quick-add no longer reads bad times like "99:99", "13pm" or "23h60"
  as real times, and a price or quantity like "1.50" is no longer read
  as a time either. Writing a time with a dot, like "9.30am" or "at
  9.30", is new: that spelling wasn't understood before, while a bare
  decimal in the title still stays in the title. A time range now
  gives the event its start time — "3-4pm" starts at 3pm, "Standup
  9:30am-10am" at 9:30 — and the whole range is removed from the
  title instead of leaving part of it behind. "noon" and "midnight"
  are now read as 12:00 and 00:00 instead of being taken for a
  location, including at the start of a range like "noon-1pm".

## [8] - 2026-09-27

### Added

- A "Buy Me a Coffee" link on the Preferences About page, for anyone who
  wants to support Litsycal's development. The same link is declared in
  `metadata.json`'s `donations` key, so extensions.gnome.org can show its
  own donate button.
- Hover tooltips on the footer buttons (new event, pin, sync, calendar app,
  settings). They were icon-only, with their label reachable by screen
  reader alone; the tooltip now shows that same string, reusing the day-cell
  tooltip's hover delay.

### Changed

- The event dialog's start and end times are typed rather than picked from
  a fixed half-hour list, so any minute works. Most everyday shapes are
  understood — `9`, `930`, `9:30`, `9.30`, `9h30`, `9:30pm`, `9 pm` — and
  anything unreadable reverts to the previous time. Clicking a time still
  opens a list, now in quarter-hour steps, that follows what you type; the
  end time's list shows each option's length (`11:00 (1 h)`). With the list
  closed, Up/Down step the time by a quarter hour. Times follow the 12h/24h
  setting.
- Moving an event's start (date or time) now moves its end along with it,
  keeping the length. An end time earlier than the start rolls over to the
  next day, so a 23:00 start can end at 00:30. Saving an event that ends
  before it starts is refused with an error instead of being written.
- The event dialog's time zone preview shows the whole meeting in each
  zone, start to end (`3:00–4:30pm`), and updates when the end changes too,
  not only the start. When the meeting lands on a different day in a zone,
  that row shows the weekday (`Tue 3:00–4:30am`), on both ends if it
  crosses midnight there. Rows where any part of the meeting falls outside
  8:00–18:00 in that zone are dimmed and marked with a moon icon.
- New events that start late in the evening default to ending an hour
  later on the next day, instead of at an earlier time on the same day.
- Clicking elsewhere in the event dialog closes whichever list (calendar,
  date, time, repeat, alert) is open, instead of leaving it up until Escape
  or another pick.
- The pin button's label now reads "Pin calendar open (P); click to unpin",
  and the README's shortcut table no longer claims `P` unpins. A pinned
  calendar deliberately holds no keyboard focus — that's what keeps the rest
  of the desktop usable while it stays visible — so no shortcut reaches it
  once pinned, and unpinning is click-only.
- The dark and calendar-page badge styles now stand out on GNOME's default
  black top bar. The dark style has a faint light outline (its dark fill
  alone disappeared against the bar), and both calendar-page styles have a
  red top band, like a tear-off calendar, instead of differing from the
  plain styles only by a thicker top edge.
- Events stored in plain UTC, as many CalDAV and ICS feeds store every
  event, no longer say "Originally scheduled in UTC" in the event details.
  The note is kept for events that name a time zone.
- The Time format preference's subtitle is shorter, so its value
  ("24-hour (13:05)") is no longer cut short.

### Fixed

- The event dialog could fail to close (Cancel, Escape and clicking outside
  all did nothing) when nothing in the Shell had keyboard focus.
- The search panel (Ctrl+F) moves up when its results appear, instead of
  letting them run off the bottom of the screen. It was placed once while
  still empty and never again.
- A pinned calendar now fits on short screens. The agenda's height cap was
  worked out as if the calendar started right under the top bar and had no
  padding, which the dropdown menu hid but a pinned calendar didn't: on a
  900px-tall screen its footer, pin button included, ran off the bottom, so
  it couldn't be unpinned.
- GNOME Shell no longer crashes on logout or shutdown while Litsycal is
  enabled. Litsycal's connection to Evolution Data Server was only released
  during the Shell's final teardown, and releasing it there made the Shell
  run code that no longer existed (after the session had already ended, so
  nothing was lost, but it left a crash report behind every time). That
  connection now runs on its own event loop, so releasing it can never
  touch the Shell's. Calendars added, removed, enabled or disabled in
  another app now take up to 5 seconds to show up; event changes still
  appear immediately.
- Time zone clocks no longer cut the time short (e.g. "4:3…" instead of
  "4:36pm") on a small calendar with a large font, most visibly with the
  12h format. The dotted leader between city and time now only fills the
  space left over, and the time and its offset never shrink — a long city
  name is what shortens instead. Also applies to the event dialog's time
  zone preview, which shares the same row.

- The Time Zones clocks no longer show a stale time when the calendar is
  opened. They only refreshed on a timer that runs while the calendar is
  visible, and opening the menu didn't trigger one. That timer also ran
  every 60s from whenever the extension was enabled, so the clocks and the
  panel badge's time could lag GNOME's own clock by up to 59s. It now fires
  on each minute boundary.

## [7] - 2026-09-13

### Added

- The delete-confirmation prompt supports Tab/Shift+Tab to cycle focus
  between its buttons (Cancel focused by default), matching keyboard
  navigation elsewhere in the app.
- The New Event form now defaults to whichever calendar you picked last
  time, instead of always defaulting to the first calendar in the list
  (often "Birthdays & Anniversaries"). No new setting — it's just
  remembered automatically each time you save a new event.
- The New Event form now shows what the selected start time converts to in
  each zone from your Time Zones list (Preferences), so scheduling with
  someone elsewhere doesn't require doing the math yourself. Hidden when
  that list is empty or the event is all-day.
- The event info popover now shows "Originally scheduled in `<zone>`" for
  an event whose own timezone differs from your system's — e.g. an invite
  synced in from someone in another region. Known limitation: this compares
  timezone names directly, so a differently-named alias for the same zone
  (e.g. `US/Eastern` vs `America/New_York`) can still show the note even
  though it's the same real-world zone.
- Each zone in the Time Zones list (both the calendar's own clocks and the
  New Event form's preview) now shows how far ahead/behind it is from a new
  "Home Timezone" setting (Preferences), e.g. "São Paulo 04:30 (-6h)" — no
  more doing the math yourself when scheduling across zones. Home timezone
  can be picked manually or detected automatically via GNOME's location
  service (a new "Detect my location" button in Preferences). Note that
  detecting sets home to wherever you physically are *right now* — correct
  only if you're actually at home when you click it; if you're traveling,
  pick your real home city from the list instead. Offset labels are hidden
  entirely until a home timezone is set. The "Detect my location" button is
  hidden if the required system location services aren't installed, rather
  than preventing Preferences from opening at all.

### Changed

- The event info popover no longer closes itself after 60 seconds; it stays
  open until you dismiss it (Escape, clicking outside, or deleting).
- A custom hourly-beep sound now plays through GNOME Shell's own sound
  player (the same one the default bell uses) instead of the external
  `paplay` command, and the Preferences preview plays in-process — neither
  needs PulseAudio's command-line tools installed any more.

### Fixed

- Events synced in with an explicit timezone (e.g. a calendar invite from
  someone in a different region) displayed the wrong local time — the
  organizer's clock time was shown as-is, mislabeled as your own local
  time, instead of being converted. Event times are now converted to your
  system's timezone when read, and saved edits are anchored to your
  system's timezone too, so the event's real time no longer shifts for
  other viewers after an unrelated field is edited and saved. The
  "Originally scheduled in `<zone>`" note is now only shown when
  conversion actually succeeded. Known limitation: a non-IANA timezone name
  (as some Windows/Exchange sources use) still isn't converted, same as
  before this fix.

- The event info popover's delete button deleted a non-recurring event
  immediately, with no confirmation prompt — a mis-click right next to the
  event title (the delete button sits directly beside it) deleted the
  event outright. `confirmDeleteEvent` now always shows a confirm/cancel
  prompt before deleting, not just for recurring events.
- The New Event form's URL field accepted any text and saved it as-is; the
  event info popover then rendered it as a clickable "Open link" row with a
  link icon even when it wasn't an actual link (e.g. plain text typed into
  the wrong field), and clicking it silently did nothing. Saving now
  rejects a URL that doesn't include a scheme (e.g. `https://`, or an
  authority-less scheme like `mailto:`), unless that field's value came in
  unchanged from a synced event (so editing an unrelated field on an event
  synced in with non-URL text already in its URL field, e.g. a room code,
  isn't blocked). The event info popover and the agenda's own "Open link"
  button both fall back to plain text/no button instead of a
  clickable-looking link for a non-URL value.
- Editing an event with reminders the form can't represent (several alarms,
  an absolute trigger, a non-display alarm, ...) and saving any change
  deleted all of its reminders. They're now kept as-is unless you pick a
  different Alert.
- An all-day event created on the last day of a month was saved with an
  invalid end date (e.g. September 31st). The end date now rolls over into
  the next month/year correctly.
- Enabling the extension logged thousands of "not in the stage" warnings
  (the agenda height was measured before the calendar was on screen), plus
  "percentage lengths not currently supported" warnings from
  `border-radius: 50%` rules St was ignoring anyway. Both are gone, with no
  visual change.
- Disabling the extension (including on every screen lock) while calendar
  requests or deferred UI updates were still pending could leave callbacks
  running against torn-down widgets, leak live calendar views, or crash a
  floating panel closed before it finished positioning. Pending calendar
  requests are now cancelled and every deferred callback is removed on
  close/disable. The delete-confirmation prompt opened from an agenda row's
  right-click menu is now also closed on disable instead of being left
  holding its input grab.
- Disabling the extension — which GNOME does on every screen lock — never
  actually ran the calendar's own cleanup: the calendar widget went down
  with its menu from C code, which skips its JavaScript `destroy()`. Each
  lock left a detached copy of the calendar still connected to your
  settings and calendars, logging "has been already disposed" errors
  whenever a setting or an event changed, and piling up with every lock.
  The indicator now destroys the calendar explicitly on disable, and that
  cleanup no longer calls a non-existent disconnect on calendar clients
  (which logged a GLib critical per calendar).

## [6] - 2026-09-12

### Added

- A "Sync" button in the footer, next to the pin button, does the same
  server sync + refetch as `Ctrl+Alt+R`.
- The event info popover now lists attendees for events that have any,
  each with a colored status dot (green = accepted, red = declined,
  amber = tentative, grey = no response yet) — Itsycal's own attendee
  coloring, ported. Capped at 5 shown, with a "+N more" row beyond that.
- Appearance has a new "Show countdown to next meeting" toggle: when
  today has an upcoming or in-progress video-call meeting, the panel
  icon shows a meeting icon + countdown ("5m", "1h 20m", "now") in a
  pill matching the chosen icon style. A second option, "When a meeting
  is coming up", controls whether that countdown replaces the normal
  icon text or sits alongside it. Off by default.
- `Ctrl+Shift+N` quick-adds an event from a single line, e.g. "Lunch
  tomorrow 12pm at Cafe Nero" — parses title/date/time/location out of
  the text and opens the full New Event form pre-filled with whatever
  it recognized, for you to confirm or fix before anything is actually
  saved (it never saves directly from the one-liner). `Ctrl+N` still
  opens a blank form as before. Weekday names are recognized in your
  system's own locale automatically; the fixed keywords ("today",
  "tomorrow", "next", "at") are translatable and currently only ship in
  English — a pt_BR translation for them is included as an example for
  future translation packs.
- `Ctrl+F` searches every connected calendar (not just whichever month the
  grid currently shows) for matching titles, notes, and locations, roughly
  a year back and forward — EDS filters server/backend-side, so this stays
  fast even with several calendars. Selecting a result navigates the grid
  to that date and opens the same read-only info popover a normal agenda
  click does.

### Fixed

- `Ctrl+F` search could surface (and let you navigate to) events from a
  calendar you'd explicitly disabled — `searchEvents` now excludes disabled
  calendars the same way the grid/agenda already do.
- Quick-adding a time later than the current hour (e.g. "call at 3pm" typed
  at 10am) prefilled the New Event form with an end time before its start
  (end time was always wall-clock-relative, ignoring the parsed draft).

- The extension could fail to activate at all under `mutter-devkit`'s nested
  Shell (`scripts/dev-session.sh`) with `TypeError: can't access property
  "height", monitor is null`, leaving no panel icon: `_updateAgendaMaxHeight`
  ran during the very first grid build, before the nested session's
  layoutManager had registered a monitor. It now skips that one pass when no
  monitor is available yet instead of throwing; the height cap gets set on
  the next agenda rebuild once the monitor exists.
- Editing an event's Notes (or any other field) via the Edit dialog could
  fail with "Cannot modify calendar object: ... HTTP error code 409" for
  meeting-style events (e.g. ones with a Google Meet link). The save path
  rebuilt the whole event from scratch using only the fields our Edit
  dialog exposes and PUT that as a full replacement, silently dropping
  properties Google's backend had attached (ORGANIZER, ATTENDEE,
  conferencing data, ...); Google's CalDAV backend rejects a modification
  that would strip that structure off an existing meeting. Saving an edit
  now fetches the live event and patches only the fields the dialog
  actually changed onto it, leaving everything else untouched.
- `Ctrl+Alt+R` (refresh events) could visibly do nothing: it only re-read
  whatever GNOME's calendar service (evolution-data-server) already had
  cached locally, never asking a backend like Google's own to check for
  anything new. EDS polls that on its own schedule (commonly ~30 minutes),
  so pressing the shortcut right after a change on Google's side often had
  nothing new to show yet. The shortcut now also asks each calendar source
  that supports it to sync with its server immediately; any changes that
  come back still reach litsycal the normal way, through its existing
  live-update signals.

## [5] - 2026-09-12

### Added

- Appearance now has a "Short day names" toggle for the grid's weekday
  header row: single-letter labels (M T W T F S S) instead of the default
  three-letter abbreviations, derived from the same locale data so it works
  in any language (e.g. S T Q Q S S D for pt_BR) without new translation
  strings for the letters themselves.
- The event info popover's Notes text now splits around any URLs it
  contains (e.g. the "Join with Google Meet: <url>" boilerplate many
  calendar servers add) so each one renders as its own clickable row
  instead of inert text.

### Changed

- The agenda list's icon for a plain URL (as opposed to a detected meeting
  link) now sits inline with the time, coloured to match the event's own
  calendar — the same treatment the meeting-join icon already had, instead
  of a separate grey icon in its own column at the far right.

### Fixed

- Clicking an event with a meeting link, a URL, or a link embedded in its
  notes broke the event info popover: instead of the usual small card, it
  rendered as a hugely oversized, mostly-empty rectangle covering most of
  the screen. A negative CSS margin on the popover's link-row style class
  (`margin: -2px -4px`, meant to offset extra padding for a bigger hover
  area) corrupted that row's computed height on this Shell version — an
  underlying Clutter/St layout bug (reproducibly returns exactly 2^33
  regardless of content), not a logic error, and no exception was ever
  thrown. Removing the negative margin fixes it; see CLAUDE.md's dev notes
  for how this was tracked down.

## [4] - 2026-09-10

### Added

- Clicking an event in the agenda now opens a compact, read-only info
  popover next to the row — itsycal's own AgendaPopoverVC, ported — instead
  of jumping straight into the full edit form: title, date/time, location,
  recurrence, a Join meeting button when applicable, notes, and URL, with a
  small arrow pointing at the clicked row and a delete button. `Esc` closes
  it, `Backspace`/`Delete` deletes the event (with the same repeating-event
  confirmation prompt as the edit dialog's own Delete button), and clicking
  toggles it: clicking outside or on the same event again closes it,
  clicking a different event switches straight to that one's popover in
  the same click. Respects the font-size setting. Editing an event now
  lives one step further away, in the row's right-click menu's new Edit…
  entry. Documented in the wiki's Keyboard Shortcuts page.
- Rounded out the rest of Itsycal's keyboard shortcuts (mowglii.com/itsycal/help)
  on top of the existing h/j/k/l day/week/month/year navigation: `#` flashes
  the selected day's offset from today and day-of-year in the month label;
  `Ctrl+J`/`Ctrl+K` add/remove a calendar week row; `P` pins/unpins the
  calendar; `W` and `.` toggle week numbers and agenda event locations;
  `Ctrl+,` opens Settings; `Ctrl+O` opens the default calendar app; `Ctrl+N`
  creates a new event; `Ctrl+Shift+T` goes to a date; `Ctrl+Alt+R` refreshes
  events; `Ctrl+Q` quits Litsycal. Itsycal's Command-tier shortcuts move to
  Ctrl (no Command key on Linux); opening the first active meeting
  (Itsycal's `⌘J`) becomes `Ctrl+Shift+J` instead of plain `Ctrl+J`, which
  is already taken by add-week-row. Documented in the README and wiki's
  Keyboard Shortcuts sections.
- Settings menu (gear button in the calendar footer, or right-clicking the
  panel icon): About, Check for updates (not implemented yet), Go to date,
  Settings, Appearance, Help, and Quit Litsycal — each with a matching icon.
  The calendar dropdown stays open behind the menu; selecting About,
  Settings, Appearance, Help, or Quit closes it afterwards, while Go to date
  leaves it open and floats a small yyyy-mm-dd entry in front of it that
  jumps the calendar straight to that day. About, Settings, and Appearance
  each open the Preferences window on the matching tab; Help opens the
  project wiki.
- Resize handle below the calendar grid, mirroring Itsycal's own: drag it
  down to reveal up to five extra weeks of next month's dates (dragging
  back up hides them again). The chosen row count is remembered across
  month navigation and reopening the calendar.
- Calendar system preference (Gregorian/Buddhist): shows the year as
  Gregorian + 543 in the header, day-cell accessible names, and the event
  creation/editing date pickers. Only the displayed year changes — month
  and day layout, and the dates actually saved to events, stay Gregorian.
- Multi-day events now show a dot and an agenda entry on every day they
  span, not just their start day, mirroring Itsycal's own EventCenter,
  which walks each event's full date range rather than just its start date.
- Hovering a multi-day event in the agenda list now highlights every day it
  spans in the calendar grid above, using the same tint as a plain day-cell
  hover — mirrors Itsycal's `agendaHoveredOverRow`/`highlightCellsFromDate`.
- Overflow (adjacent-month) days now show event dots too, faded to signal
  they're outside the active month while keeping each event's own colour —
  matching Itsycal. They're fully interactive like a real day cell: hover
  tint, the hover-delay day tooltip, and click/keyboard selection. Selecting
  one mirrors Itsycal's `MoCalendar` exactly: the displayed month stays put
  and the selection lands on the visible overflow cell itself, only jumping
  months once navigation moves the selection off the whole rendered grid
  (not merely into a different calendar month).
- Two Appearance preferences for the agenda list, mirroring Itsycal: "Show
  event location" (on by default, matching the existing unconditional
  behaviour) hides each event's location row when off; "Show days with no
  events" (off by default) lists every day in the agenda range instead of
  skipping empty ones, matching Itsycal's `ShowLocation`/
  `ShowDaysWithNoEventsInAgenda`. The very first day in the range still
  always shows (with a "No events" label when empty), regardless of the
  latter setting — unchanged from litsycal's existing behaviour.
- Right-clicking an agenda event now opens a context menu — Open Calendar,
  Copy, Delete… — mirroring Itsycal's agenda context menu
  (`AgendaViewController.menuNeedsUpdate:`). Open Calendar launches
  `gnome-calendar --date` on the event's own date rather than just the app
  (Itsycal's `showCalendarAppAtDate:`); Copy writes the title, date/time, and
  location to the clipboard (Itsycal's `copyEventToPasteboard:`); Delete…
  reuses the same this-event/all-events confirmation as the event edit
  panel's own Delete button (Itsycal's `deleteEvent:`/
  `agendaWantsToDeleteEvent:`), now factored out into a shared
  `confirmDeleteEvent` helper so both places stay in sync.

### Changed

- The gear button in the calendar footer and right-clicking the panel icon
  now both open the new settings menu above instead of jumping straight to
  the Preferences window.
- Preferences window widened slightly (480px → 600px) so its General/
  Appearance/About tab switcher stays in the header instead of collapsing to
  a bottom bar — libadwaita's own responsive behaviour, not something this
  project controls directly, but the extra width keeps clear of the
  breakpoint.

### Fixed

- The event dialog's Ends date reverted to the start date every time a
  multi-day event was reopened, even though the correct end date was saved
  and shown correctly elsewhere (e.g. GNOME Calendar). The calendar reader
  parsed `DTEND`'s time but never its date, so the dialog had nothing but
  the start date to fall back to.
- A calendar row in Preferences → Calendars could render completely blank
  (no colour dot, no name) if its source reported colour as `rgb(...)`
  rather than hex — valid everywhere else in the app, but rejected by the
  Pango markup the row's title was built from, which silently dropped the
  whole title. The colour dot is now its own widget, parsed with
  `Gdk.RGBA` (hex, `rgb()`/`rgba()`/`hsl()`, and named colours all work),
  so the title text can't be taken down by an unexpected colour format.
- Calendar source colour is now normalized to hex once, right where it's
  read from EDS, instead of every consumer needing to tolerate whatever
  format a given backend hands back (this is what let Google's `rgb(...)`
  colour reach the Preferences title in the first place).
- Pinning the calendar (the pin button in its footer) would visibly shrink
  and shift it: its width was measured right after detaching it from the
  open popup, when it briefly reads as 0 (no layout pass yet), and its
  position was re-derived from the panel button's coordinates rather than
  reused from where it was already showing. Both are now captured from the
  calendar's actual on-screen size and position just before the detach.
- Every floating popup (settings menu, event edit panel, go-to-date panel,
  delete confirmation, day-cell hover tooltip) briefly flashed its shadow at
  the screen's top-left corner when opened. Each is added to the screen
  before its real position can be computed (that needs a layout pass to know
  the popup's size first), so it was visible at its pre-layout `(0, 0)`
  default for a frame. Each now starts at `opacity: 0` and only becomes
  visible once actually positioned.
- Pressing Escape in the event edit panel (or its delete confirmation) closed
  the whole calendar dropdown instead of just that panel, and afterwards
  every keyboard shortcut went dead until the extension was reloaded. Two
  compounding bugs: Escape was only listened for on `global.stage`, which
  the calendar dropdown's own modal grab intercepts before it gets there, so
  its built-in close-on-Escape fired instead; and the callback that clears
  the calendar's reference to the closed panel only ran on a successful
  save/delete, not on a plain cancel, so that stale reference permanently
  blocked the in-calendar keyboard handler. Both panels now take their own
  competing modal grab (matching the settings/go-to-date panels) and notify
  their caller from a single always-runs `close()`.
- An agenda event's right-click "Open Calendar" always opened GNOME Calendar
  on today's date instead of the event's date. It passed the event date in
  ISO `YYYY-MM-DD` to `gnome-calendar --date`, but that flag is parsed with
  evolution-data-server's `e_time_parse_date_and_time()`, which expects the
  locale's own short-date order (`MM/DD/YYYY` for en_US, `DD/MM/YYYY`
  elsewhere, ...) — the ISO string never matched, so gnome-calendar silently
  fell back to today. The date is now formatted with GLib's own `%x` first,
  matching whatever order `gnome-calendar` itself expects on the running
  system.

## [3] - 2026-09-08

### Added

- Font size preference: an S/M/L slider (alongside the existing calendar
  Size slider) that scales all popup text independently of the calendar's
  button/grid dimensions.

### Changed

- Default calendar text size increased slightly for readability.
- Week numbers in the week-number gutter are now bold.

### Fixed

- Week-number gutter alignment: the `sm-plus` and `md-plus` calendar sizes
  had no dedicated gutter width/font-size rules and silently fell back to
  the base (`md`) values, throwing off the column's proportions at those two
  sizes. Every size class now scales the gutter in step with the day-name
  column.
- Week numbers sat at the grid row's raw geometric center, while day numbers
  sit slightly above it (the number+dot-row stack is centered as a group,
  and the reserved dot-row space below the number pulls that group's center
  down). Each week-number cell now reproduces the same number+dot-row
  composition as a day cell, so it lines up with the day numbers instead of
  the row's midpoint.
- The week-number gutter had no row-to-row spacing while the grid itself
  spaces its rows 4px apart, so each gutter cell drifted another 4px out of
  line with its row — barely visible on row one, worst by the last row.
  Matching that spacing on the gutter fixed the drift but also inserted an
  extra gap between the top spacer and row one (where the real grid has
  none), pushing every row down by one gap too many. Nesting the row cells
  in their own box, spaced to match the grid, fixes both: no gap before row
  one, matching 4px between every row after.

## [2] - 2026-09-07

### Added

- Keyboard navigation inside the open calendar: arrow keys (and vi-style
  `h`/`j`/`k`/`l`) move the selected day, Shift moves by month/year, and
  Space jumps to today. Documented in the README's new Keyboard Shortcuts
  section.

### Fixed

- The in-calendar key listener never actually fired: it was attached to
  `global.stage`, but the popup's modal grab scopes event delivery to the
  menu's own actor, so the listener needed to move there instead.
- Bare `Down` (with or without Shift) can never reach the calendar at all —
  GNOME Shell's `PopupMenu` reserves that keysym for its own accessibility
  keynav whenever a menu drops down from the top panel, and consumes it
  before any of the extension's own handlers run. `j`/`Shift+J` are the
  reliable way to trigger that direction now.
- `Shift+Up`/`Shift+Down` moved through years in the opposite direction from
  what was intended (`Shift+Up` now goes forward a year, `Shift+Down`/
  `Shift+J` back).
